# System Guardian üõ°Ô∏è

An AI-powered incident management platform designed to autonomously monitor, analyze, and suggest resolutions for on-call incidents. System Guardian integrates with tools like Slack, GitHub, Datadog, and more to provide **real-time insights** and **AI-driven remediation suggestions**.

## üåü Features

- **Real-time Incident Detection**: Ingests and processes events from **Datadog, GitHub, Jira**, and other sources
- **AI-Powered Resolution Suggestions**: Uses **GPT-4o / GTP-4o-mini** and **retrieval-based search** with **Qdrant** to suggest fixes based on historical incidents
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Utilizes **RabbitMQ** for reliable message streaming and processing
- **Scalable & Modular**: Microservice-based structure with **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Elasticsearch**
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Tracks incidents, logs, and system health using **Datadog & ELK stack**

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installation

Clone the repository and set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/system_guardian.git
cd system_guardian
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and configure the necessary settings:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file and modify with your own values
cp .env.example .env
```

Then update the `.env` file with your configuration:

```bash
SYSTEM_GUARDIAN_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
SYSTEM_GUARDIAN_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your-slack-bot-token
SYSTEM_GUARDIAN_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=channel-id
SYSTEM_GUARDIAN_JIRA_URL=your_jira_url
SYSTEM_GUARDIAN_JIRA_USERNAME=your_jira_email
SYSTEM_GUARDIAN_JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_jira_api_token
SYSTEM_GUARDIAN_JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=your_project_key
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application

#### Development Environment

Start the development environment services (Database, RabbitMQ, Qdrant) using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

Then run the FastAPI service locally:

```bash
poetry run python -m system_guardian
```

#### Docker Compose Setup (Experimental)

> **Note**: The whole project Docker Compose setup is currently under development and not yet ready for use. 

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```

This will launch the following services:
- API service (system_guardian)
- Event consumer service (event_consumer_service)
- PostgreSQL database
- RabbitMQ message queue
- Qdrant vector database

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Webhook Setup with ngrok

To receive webhooks from external services (GitHub, Jira, etc.), you'll need to expose your local server to the internet. We recommend using ngrok for this purpose:

1. Install ngrok:
```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install ngrok

# Windows with Chocolatey
choco install ngrok

# Linux
snap install ngrok
```

2. Sign up for a free ngrok account at [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) and get your authtoken

3. Configure ngrok with your authtoken:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken your-authtoken
```

4. Start ngrok to expose your FastAPI server:
```bash
ngrok http --domain=your-domain 5566
```

5. Update your webhook URLs in external services with the ngrok URL:
- GitHub webhook URL: `https://your-ngrok-url/api/v1/ingest/github/`
- Jira webhook URL: `https://your-ngrok-url/api/v1/ingest/jira/`
- Datadog webhook URL: `https://your-ngrok-url/api/v1/ingest/datadog/`
