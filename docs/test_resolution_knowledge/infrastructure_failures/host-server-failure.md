# Host Server Failure

## Metadata
- **ID**: d2d7eebb-1677-484e-969d-ae07546ff8ab
- **Category**: infrastructure_failures
- **Severity**: critical

## Symptoms
- Server unresponsive to ping or SSH
- Services hosted on server unavailable
- Error logs showing connection timeouts
- Monitoring system alerts for host down

## Resolution Steps

1. Verify if server is truly unreachable: ping, SSH, console access

2. Check physical server status if accessible (power, network)

3. For cloud instances, check cloud provider status dashboard

4. Attempt server restart through management console

5. If restart fails, initiate disaster recovery protocol

6. Provision replacement server if necessary

7. Restore from backup or rehydrate from infrastructure as code

8. Redirect traffic to new server (update DNS, load balancer)

## Prevention
- Implement high availability architecture
- Use infrastructure as code for quick recovery
- Regular backup testing and validation
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting
- Document recovery procedures and test them regularly
