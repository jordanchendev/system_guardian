# False Positive Monitoring Alerts

## Metadata
- **ID**: ffa0cd32-f51e-4b85-8c73-bed01ddb2c36
- **Category**: monitoring_alerts
- **Severity**: low

## Symptoms
- Frequent alerts that don't correspond to real issues
- Alert fatigue among team members
- Alerts triggering during known maintenance windows
- Inconsistent alert behavior across similar systems

## Resolution Steps

1. Document pattern of false positives

2. Analyze alert threshold settings

3. Check for environmental factors causing baseline shifts

4. Implement more sophisticated alerting logic (e.g., duration-based thresholds)

5. Add maintenance window functionality to monitoring system

6. Adjust sensitivity of alerts based on historical data

7. Consider implementing anomaly detection instead of static thresholds

8. Create alert suppression rules for known maintenance activities

## Prevention
- Regular review and tuning of alert thresholds
- Use trending data to set dynamic thresholds
- Implement alert correlation to reduce noise
- Classify alerts by importance and actionability
- Document expected system behavior for different conditions
