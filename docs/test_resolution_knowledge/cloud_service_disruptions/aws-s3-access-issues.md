# AWS S3 Access Issues

## Metadata
- **ID**: e48f84ce-d185-4c45-9184-fc25a6edabc8
- **Category**: cloud_service_disruptions
- **Severity**: high

## Symptoms
- Applications unable to read or write to S3 buckets
- Timeout errors when accessing S3
- Increased latency in S3 operations
- Error logs showing S3 access denied or throttling

## Resolution Steps

1. Check AWS Service Health Dashboard for S3 outages

2. Verify IAM permissions for the accessing role/user

3. Check bucket policy and ACLs

4. Test S3 access using AWS CLI: `aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name/`

5. Check for S3 endpoint connectivity issues

6. Verify that bucket region matches application configuration

7. Implement retry with exponential backoff for S3 operations

8. For critical operations, temporarily switch to backup storage if available

## Prevention
- Implement caching layer in front of S3
- Use multi-region bucket replication for critical data
- Monitor S3 operation latency and error rates
- Implement circuit breakers for S3 operations
- Have backup storage solution for critical operations
