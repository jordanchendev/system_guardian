## Metadata
- **ID**: 72b824b9-8d47-4fac-8309-a211815cdccd
- **Category**: security_incidents
- **Severity**: critical

## Symptoms
- Multiple failed login attempts from unusual IP ranges
- Unusual login patterns (time of day, geolocation)
- Attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities in auth system
- Unusual account privilege escalation attempts

## Resolution Steps

1. Temporarily block suspicious IP ranges at firewall or WAF

2. Enable additional authentication factors for admin accounts

3. Analyze logs to identify the attack pattern and scope

4. Check for successful breaches by reviewing user activity logs

5. Reset credentials for any potentially compromised accounts

6. Apply security patches if vulnerability exploitation was attempted

7. Increase logging detail for authentication systems

8. Report incident to security team and follow incident response plan

## Prevention
- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Use captcha or challenge questions for repeated failed attempts
- Deploy intrusion detection systems
- Implement anomaly detection for login patterns
- Regular security penetration testing
- Keep authentication systems patched and updated
