# API Rate Limiting Errors

## Metadata
- **ID**: 786dc0a6-4e4f-4c6a-a807-c0acbbfd185e
- **Category**: application_errors
- **Severity**: medium

## Symptoms
- HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses
- Sudden failure of API-dependent functionalities
- Error logs showing rate limit exceeded
- Increasing latency in API responses before failures

## Resolution Steps

1. Identify which API is being rate limited

2. Check current rate limit usage and quotas

3. Implement exponential backoff and retry strategy

4. Check for inefficient API usage patterns (e.g., unnecessary polling)

5. Distribute requests across multiple API keys if available

6. Implement request batching where possible

7. Cache API responses where appropriate

8. Contact API provider for quota increase if necessary

## Prevention
- Monitor API usage rates and implement alerts before limits are reached
- Design applications with rate limits in mind
- Implement client-side throttling
- Use bulk API endpoints where available
- Implement proper caching strategy
