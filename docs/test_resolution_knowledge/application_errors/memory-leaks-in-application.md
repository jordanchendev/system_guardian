# Memory Leaks in Application

## Metadata
- **ID**: d22c8ef8-8691-425c-8a29-3c486d006062
- **Category**: application_errors
- **Severity**: high

## Symptoms
- Gradually increasing memory usage over time
- OutOfMemoryError exceptions
- Application slowdown before crash
- Increasing garbage collection frequency

## Resolution Steps

1. Verify memory leak with monitoring tools

2. Take heap dump: `jmap -dump:format=b,file=heap.bin <pid>` (Java) or appropriate tool for your language

3. Analyze heap dump with analyzer tool (e.g., Eclipse MAT for Java)

4. Identify objects with high retention

5. Look for references preventing garbage collection

6. Check for unclosed resources (DB connections, file handles, etc.)

7. Deploy temporary fix: increase heap size or implement scheduled restarts

8. Fix the code by properly releasing resources or removing circular references

## Prevention
- Regular memory usage monitoring
- Memory leak detection in CI/CD pipeline
- Load testing with memory analysis
- Code reviews focused on resource management
- Use tools like leak canaries or sanitizers in testing
